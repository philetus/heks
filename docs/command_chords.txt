four command buttons begin command chords:

> move (multiple secondary presses escalates)
  - advance
  - retreat
  - expand
  - collapse
> glyphs
  - word / phrase (series)
  - phrasecode (like a macro expansion)
  - pos number (null => bool true)
  - neg number (null => bool false)
> container
  - buffer (document) (empty => command line)
  - blessing (heading is blessing?) (and/or) (if...then)
  - (method) call (provides space for args)
  - variable dereference (name in text?) (empty -> containing object)
    (nested - package)
> edit
  - toggle select
  - cut / clear
  - paste
  - comment (comments are directed at selected thing) 
    (when nothing is selected, inserts floating comment)
> buffer
  - new buffer
  - commit
